    I decided to go for numerical flags in this case, which, in hindsight, seems stupid,
    since all other flags on the game are actually easy to read string... sorry.

    I can't be bothered to change this at the moment, but it shouldn't take that long tbh.

    THE TWEENING FUNCTION â„¢
    ----------------------

    Duration: how long the tween will take
    Object: the TABLE with the FIELDS that will be tweened
    Target: the TABLE with the TARGETS of the tween
    Method: 'linear', 'easein', 'easeout', 'easeinout'
    After: function to be called after the tween is completed

    -----------------------

    Ok, so here's the deal with Object and Target: They both have to be tables,
    and they have to have MATCHING INDEXES so that my dumb program know what to change!
    
    EXAMPLE TIME:
    =============
    player = {x = 100, y = 100}
    time:tween(2, player, {x = 700})
    =============

    In this example, player is a simple object with two fields representing positions.
    The field being tweened is player.x, so the target has to have a matching index (x).
    You don't really need to pass a method or a function, as they default to linear and an 
    empty function, respectively.

    =============
    player = {
        pos = {
            x = 100, 
            y = 100
        },
        speed = 100
    }
    time:tween(2, player.pos, {x = 700, y = 1000}, 'easeinout')
    =============

    In this example, player is a little bit more complex, and has a position
    table inside itself to store it's x and it's y (more closely to an object in a real game). 
    Sadly my tweening engine is shit, so it can't deal with tables inside of tables, so the object 
    in this case HAS TO BE player.pos, since the target fields (x and y) are inside it. But notice 
    how you can actually tween many values at once, as long as they are inside the same table.
    
    What this means is that if you wanted to also tween the player.speed, you would actually have
    to call a different tween function, since speed is an entry in a diferent table (player), when compared
    to x and y (inside player.pos)
    
    =============
    color = {1, 1, 1, 1}
    time:tween(2, color, {0, 0, 0})
    =============

    This actualy works, because the numerical indexes in target can be mapped to the 
    numerical indexes in color, since lua assigns numerical indexes when you don't specify
    keys yourself. The first three entries in color would be tweened in this case.

    =============
    color = {r = 1, g = 1, b = 1, a = 1}
    time:tween(2, color, {0, 0, 0, 0})
    =============

    This, on the other hand, WON'T WORK, since the entries in the object are specific,
    and the function won't know how to access them unless they are specified in the target.

        local ok = pcall(function() return (entry-object[k])*1 end)
        assert(ok, 'Field "'..k..'" does not support arithmetic operations')

        -- adds the DIFFERENCE between TARGET and ORIGINAL FIELD to change[key]
        change[k] = (entry - object[k])
